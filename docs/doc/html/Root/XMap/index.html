      This package defines various constructs that allow XMF objects to
      be mapped and synchronised.

<TR><TD><B><A HREF="../../Root/XMap/AddAction/index.html">AddAction</A></B></TD><TD>
      An add action is a general action that can occur to a container.
      The AddAction construct is general and is specialized to particular 
      forms of container synchronization and mapping.
    </TD></TR>
<TR><TD><B><A HREF="../../Root/XMap/AddLeft/index.html">AddLeft</A></B></TD><TD>
      The AddLeft construct occurs in a SyncContainers construct and is used to
      define a daemon that fires when an element is added to the left container
      of the two being synchronized. If the left handl container is updated
      with one or more values then this daemon is fired for each new element.
      The construct has a parameter which is bound to the value which is added.
      In the body of the daemon the value of 'self' is the object being updated
      (i.e. the container). All other scoping rules apply.
      
      Constructor: AddLeft(arg,body)
      
    </TD></TR>
<TR><TD><B><A HREF="../../Root/XMap/AddRight/index.html">AddRight</A></B></TD><TD>
      See AddLeft. this is identical except that the daemon fires when an element
      is added to the right hand container.
    </TD></TR>
<TR><TD><B><A HREF="../../Root/XMap/Clause/index.html">Clause</A></B></TD><TD>
      This class manages the original concrete syntax of
      a mapping clause. It allows mappings to be dynamically
      changed.
    </TD></TR>
<TR><TD><B><A HREF="../../Root/XMap/DeleteAction/index.html">DeleteAction</A></B></TD><TD>
      A delete action is a general action that can occur to a container.
      The DeleteAction construct is general and is specialized to particular 
      forms of container synchronization and mapping.
    </TD></TR>
<TR><TD><B><A HREF="../../Root/XMap/DeleteLeft/index.html">DeleteLeft</A></B></TD><TD>
      See DeleteRight. This is the same except the daemon fires when elements are
      removed from the left hand container.
    </TD></TR>
<TR><TD><B><A HREF="../../Root/XMap/DeleteRight/index.html">DeleteRight</A></B></TD><TD>
      The DeleteRight construct occurs in a SyncContainers construct and is used to
      define a daemon that fires when an element is removed from the right container
      of the two being synchronized. If the right hand container is updated
      by deleting one or more values then this daemon is fired for each new element.
      The construct has a parameter which is bound to the value which is deleted.
      In the body of the daemon the value of 'self' is the object being updated
      (i.e. the container). All other scoping rules apply.
     
      Constructor: DeleteRight(arg,body)
    </TD></TR>
<TR><TD><B><A HREF="../../Root/XMap/Map/index.html">Map</A></B></TD><TD>
      A mapping is a class that can be used to transform
      from some domain elements to a single range element
      (NB the range element could be a collection). A
      mapping consists of a collection of clauses each
      of which has a sequence of guard patterns and a
      body. When an instance of the mapping is supplied
      with a sequence of domain elements (by applying the
      instance to the elements as arguments), each of the
      clauses is tried in turn. the first clause whose guard
      patterns match the arguments transforms the inputs
      by performing its body and returning the result
      (which should be an instance of the range).
    </TD></TR>
<TR><TD><B><A HREF="../../Root/XMap/Mapping/index.html">Mapping</A></B></TD><TD>
      All mappings inherit from this class.
    </TD></TR>
<TR><TD><B><A HREF="../../Root/XMap/SlotValueChanged/index.html">SlotValueChanged</A></B></TD><TD>
     This construct adds a daemon that fires when the given slot value changes. The
     construct allows the new value and old value to be bound. The body of the
     construct is any expression. Modifiers allow this construct to control whether
     it is fired when a slot value changes, when new values are added or when existing
     values are removed. A daemon can be a reference to an existing operation or
     can define the required operation in-line. A daemon may be persistent in which
     case it is saved when the owning object is saved. The daemon operation involves
     TWO objects: that which is in scope when the daemon is defined and the object
     that is monitored. The value of SELF in the daemon operation is always that which
     is in scope when the daemon is created. The object that is monitored is supplied
     to the daemon operation as the first argument.
   </TD></TR>
<TR><TD><B><A HREF="../../Root/XMap/Sync/index.html">Sync</A></B></TD><TD>
      This construct synchronizes two objects on respective slots. Once synchronized,
      the values of the two slots are the same. An update to the appropriate slot of
      either object will cause the change to be propagated to the other object.
      
      Constructor: Sync(object1,name1,object2,name2)
       The objects are expressions and the names are strings.
    </TD></TR>
<TR><TD><B><A HREF="../../Root/XMap/SyncContainerAction/index.html">SyncContainerAction</A></B></TD><TD>No Documentation Specified</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><B><A HREF="../../Root/XMap/SyncContainers/index.html">SyncContainers</A></B></TD><TD>
       Two containers are synchronized using this construct. A container is an object
       with a slot whose value is a collection. Containers are synchronized with respect
       to a particular slot. A container may be synchronized (for containership) more than 
       once; each time the slot may be the same or may be different. The body of this
       construct is a collection of daemon definitions. Special patterns of daemons
       for containership synchronization are provided: AddLeft; DeleteLeft; AddRight;
       DeleteRight. In each case daemons are defined that fire when elements are
       added or deleted to the left or right container with respect to the defined slot.
       The daemon bodies can be any expression and scoping rules apply except that 'self'
       is interpreted in a daemon body as the object that has changed. The value of 'self'
       currently in scope at the point of definition is referred to in each daemon as 'outerSelf'.
       In each daemon the name of the slots being synchronized are bound to the values
       after they have been updated.
       
       Constructor: SyncContainers(leftContainer,leftAttribute,rightContainer,rightAttribute,actions)
         Left and right containers are expressions, attributes are strings and actions are performable
         elements of type SynContainerAction.
